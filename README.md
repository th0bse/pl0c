# PL0C

Small and (relatively) simple compiler for the PL/0 programming language written
in Kotlin, targeting the own, custom built stack machine.

The source language, while still called PL/0 isn't actually fully compliant with
the original PL/0 by Niklaus Wirth, is loosely based on it and more a mix of 
PL/0 and SimpleC.

## How to run?
On Linux/macOS:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

On Windows:
```
./gradlew.bat clean build
```
